#telegram_manga_reader
a simple Telegram manga reader bot

**Introduction**

I created this python-based Telegram manga reader bot to read manga using the MangaEden JSON API in Telegram. Read manga together with your friends! Invite the bot along to your group chat (be sure to turn off privacy using '/setprivacy' with BotFather!) This bot is a good example of using lists in Python to process inputs and using the 'requests' library in Python.

If you need any help in setting up a bot, refer to the [Telegram Bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

**Features**
* Check the latest chapter of a manga
* Read a manga, either by page, or have the entire chapter sent to you via chat

**Credits**
* /u/Valdieme at this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TelegramBots/comments/3b8kf3/the_simplest_python_bot/) for the basic skeleton code for a python-based Telegram bot
* MangaEden for the MangaEden API
